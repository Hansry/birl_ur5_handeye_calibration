# birl_ur5_handeye_calibration

This meta-package is developed for UR5 hand-eye calibration with a ensenso 3D camera. ur5_ensenso_description contains URDF describing the mechanical setup, while ur5_handeye_calibration_moveit_config is generated by moveit setup assistant based on such setup. ur5_handeye_calibration is used for moving UR, collecting images and peroforming the final calibration computation.
